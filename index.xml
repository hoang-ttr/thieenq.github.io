      <description>From a young age, we were taught by many people about many things. But rarely did we get taught on how to teach others, unless you major in pedagogy. I has always been a autodidact, so It fascinate me how others teach themseleves.
During univeristy, I got a girlfriend, and somehow we always ended up study together even though she and I were in different departments. Naturally, I would have to study twice for both of our parts.</description>

      <description>Hi! I mostly write about data tech, traveling, personal experiences, etc.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing lots of things in my life, this is a place where I share it with the world. I hope you like it here.
Trained as an electrical engineer, I picked up work as a embedded engineer for a while then switched to data. Been data monkey-ing ever since under many hats, analyst, scientist, you name it.</description>
